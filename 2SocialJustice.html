<h1>Our Rights as weman are being threatened</h1>
<p>Weman are stong independant people and we shouldn't be degraded to something we should have a right to such as education.
Everyone needs to learn and have a right to learn no matter your gender
<h2>India's main focus is virginity and purity and think that its more important than education. As well as their countries poor economical conditions
made it hard for many familys to survive so young girls in india ouldn't go to school because they were busy getting jobs so they could support their family,
those girls won't receive proper education.</h2>
 <h3>Kham Rouge of Cambodia came into power in 1970, this change eradicated camboia's educational system. Most education for weman stop the moment they hit puberty
 It's only about 15% of cambodia's weman seek a higher education. Majority of their weman will sufferfrom domestic violence and have to work in the rice feilds or from the age of 13 work in the feilds of prostitution.</h3>
