<p>Often times there will be students in schools who are bright,
talented and smart. These students are often those who have straigt A's. However,
when the time comes to place students in advanced classes, some of these students are
places in the common core classess. The reason behind this is because
when taking imporant tests, they don't do as well as what their true potential
really is. The advanced placement relies on <b> test scores solely. </b> </p>
